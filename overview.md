This document is the specification of the API dedicated to the Keyple Kotlin Multiplatform NFC Reader Library.  
It provides an abstraction layer for NFC card communication across Android and iOS, enabling
cross-platform applications to interact with NFC media through a unified interface.

Designed for interoperability, this library simplifies the integration of NFC functionality in Kotlin Multiplatform
projects by abstracting platform-specific NFC access (CoreNFC on iOS, and Android NFC APIs).

It is typically used alongside the Keyple distributed client library to support remote NFC transactions, and is
compatible with Kotlin-based builds targeting mobile environments.
